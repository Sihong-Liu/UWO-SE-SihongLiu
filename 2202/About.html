Thinking about content and writing it takes times, and it's not the priority right now. My name is Sihong Liu and I am 20 years old, I am very glad that I got in Software Engineering program, I didn't have much experience on programming but I'll try to recall everything I've learned in highschool and Eng first year. Thank you for reading this although this is just a placeholder-ish text. This Mustang Shelby GT500 below is a very good looking car I found in a game called Forza:Horizon 5, I like it very much so I put it here.</h1>
